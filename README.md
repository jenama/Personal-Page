# Personal-Page

This is a personal portfolio page with an Homepage that introduces me, an about me link that leads to a little bio on me,
a project link that redirects the visitor to my projects, and a skills page that shows the different projects I have done. 
This webpage is done using react and css. I will also include contact information with links.
